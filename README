Player-Tracker
Keeps track of all your players using mySQL or SQLite, and optionally connects to the two largest global ban databases.

Features:

    * Discover alternate accounts by IP-matching with a single command.
    * Keep track of all the IP addresses a Player connects from, for easier & more complete bans.
    * Immediately identify alts of banned players.
    * Receive on-Join notifications about how many alts a player has been associated with.
    * Easy setup: drag, drop, and go, or fine tune your configuration.
    * Wildcard search matching, even with offline players!
    * Don't want MCBans/MCBouncer managing your bans? This plugin can allow you to look up any player on these two systems without relying on their plugins!
    * Hide certain players from lookups (Admins, VIPs, whatever) to avoid having their alts discovered!
    * Check out the screenshots page for examples! http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/player-tracker/pages/screenshots/

Installation:

    1 Drag Player-Tracker.jar into your plugins directory, and run. Further configuration only necessary if you want to use mySQL, MCBans, or MCBouncer integration.
    2 That's it.

Commands:

    * /track [-ai] <PLAYERNAME or IP ADDRESS or "stats">
    Shows all the accounts associated with a given IP or player. (-i will display all associated IPs as well, -a disables wildcard searching) /track stats will show the number of tracked accounts & IPs.

    * Hooks with FigAdmin, Banhammer, and Vanilla bans to show banned alt accounts.
    * Automatic database size limiting.
    * Approximate IP geolocation?
    * Enable sending of global bans?
